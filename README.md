ManageIQ UI Classic is the UI that has been split out of the main [manageiq repo](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq).

## Development Setup

Go to the directory where you have the clone of your 'manageiq' repo.

Next to your 'manageiq' repo create a clone of 'manageiq-ui-classic' repo:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:ManageIQ/manageiq-ui-classic.git
```

This way you will have your 'manageiq' and 'manageiq-ui-classic' side-by-side.

At this point you are ready and can start doing PRs against any of the 2 repos.

Or you can get more detailed instructions in [ManageIQ/guides](https://github.com/ManageIQ/guides/blob/master/developer_setup/plugins.md).
