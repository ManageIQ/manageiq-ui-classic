  # This priority mapping controls what connections will be present in the
  # final topology tree. Higher number means higher priority for linking.
  #
  # EXAMPLE Let us assume that we have the following tree or resources:
  #
  #   ems
  #   +-- R1
  #   |   +-- C1
  #   |   |   `-- S1
  #   |   `-- S2
  #   +-- C2
  #   |   `-- S3
  #   `-- S4
  #
  # After the graph is build, filter_link method will get as an input
  # unordered set of links, since graph-building algorithm does not guarantee
  # that links will be produced in any predetermined order. If we group edges
  # from the example tree according to the edge target, and then sort each
  # edge group according to the kind priority of the source, we get this:
  #
  #   (ems, R1),
  #   (ems, C1), (R1, C1),
  #   (ems, S1), (R1, S1), (C1, S1),
  #   (ems, S2), (R1, S2),
  #   (ems, C2),
  #   (ems, S3), (C2, S3),
  #   (ems, S4)
  #
  # Reproducing the initial tree from this set of links is now as simple as
  # taking the last edge from each group.
